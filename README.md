About this repository
---------------------

I decided to compile and maintain a set of PHP files to help write EPS files. I
have been doing mathematical illustrations in EPS for quite a while now, but
was never organized enough to put the snippets I use frequently all in one
place. I've been using PHP to help me deal with the task of writing EPS files
for a few years, and it does a good job for this! so let's see how much fun we
can have trying to build up a consistent library for illustrations in EPS.
